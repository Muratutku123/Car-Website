  <h4>Why buy Audi?</h4>

 Second-hand Audi cars are priced from £8,000 onwards. For someone looking for a cheap used Audi, you have the choice of the Audi A1 supermini, introduced in 2010 - so still a relatively new model. Alternatively, you could consider the slightly larger Audi A3. Both feature comfortable and plush interiors with excellent fuel capacity and a variety of powerful and economical engines. In the Audi world, entry-level cars are called SEs, mid-level cars are known as Sport, and the best cars are called S line trim. If you want to go beyond sportier styling, you could opt for an S-model (e.g S3), which including Audi's Quattro four-wheel drive, more powerful engines, enhanced brakes and stiffer suspension. Audi was at the forefront of the automobile industry in Germany and is currently owned by the Volkswagen Group, along with SEAT and Skoda - amongst others. The brand is well-known for its gorgeous interiors and sleek styles. Audi's prestige range-topping RS models, which stands for 'Renn Sport', compete with Mercedes' AMG models and BMW's M-Sport brand and are particularly famous for their driver control technology, aggressive styling, and highly advanced technology. 

<h4>Why buy BMW?</h4>

The cheapest BMW used cars can start from £8,000, with the BMW 1 Series hatchback being the most affordable recently manufactured model, although BMW's 3-series saloon also falls into a similar price bracket. Buyers can easily identify the model of BMW in front of them: the first number dictates the model (e.g. 3-series), followed by the engine size, whilst an 'i' indicates a petrol model and 'd' indicates diesel. BMW was the first of the big three German automotive manufacturers to launch an all-electric vehicle - the compact BMW i3. BMW vehicles offer a smooth and excellent driving experience, with rear-wheel drive. Most BMW cars have rear-wheel drive, and it is better to opt for these choices. Meanwhile, BMW dashboards make the driving experience much smoother and convenient; BMW is famed for its highly advanced entertainment and navigation systems.  Founded exactly one century ago in 1917, BMW originally manufactured aeroplanes. This Bavarian company has had a good reputation from day one and has a large number of models to choose from.
