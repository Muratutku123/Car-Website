  <h1>Who’s more reliable, BMW, Audi or Mercedes-Benz?</h1>
  <p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700">When it comes to expensive German luxury cars, reliability has always been a question.</font></p>

	<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700">When it comes to expensive German luxury cars, reliability has always been a question. There are many car enthusiasts who mock the German brand’s constant claims of excellent German engineering, as many of the Country’s cars seem to be unreliable. Now, this can be attributed to many things, such as complex engineering demanding more maintenance or American buyers simply not used to the kind of preventative maintenance that Germans take very seriously. Either way, it’s interesting to see which of the German brands are the most reliable and least expensive to own and repair.

AM-Online has done a study and developed a series of charts to demonstrate which German brands have the best reliability and lowest cost of repair. In a comparison between BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, the study shows which brand requires the most maintenance under six years of ownership, after six years and after twelve years. So this tends to show what each brand of car is like throughout the car’s entire life.</font></p>

<font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700">Things get a bit messier when digging into the finer details, though. When comparing classes of cars, such as the 1 Series/2 Series class, 3 Series class and 5 Series class, it wasn’t so cut and dry. While the positioning of the brands stayed the same, different models received different repair costs. For instance, both BMW’s and Audi’s lesser expensive models were less expensive to fix, which seems pretty standard. But for Mercedes-Benz, the more expensive models were the least expensive to fix, likely having to do with better build quality and reliability.

When getting into specific routine repairs and components, things get even messier. When it comes to servicing and MOT testing, the roles are reversed, with Audi being the cheapest, BMW still staying in the middle and Mercedes being the most expensive. This trend continues with brakes and exhaust repairs, however, Audi becomes significantly cheaper than BMW and Mercedes becomes significantly more expensive. For electrical work and batteries, BMW shined and was the least expensive, followed by Audi and Mercedes, respectively. However, BMW was the most expensive brand to repair steering and suspension components.</font></p>
