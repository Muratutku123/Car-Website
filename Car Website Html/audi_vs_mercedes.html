<h2>Audi
vs Mercedes-Benz - Which Luxury Vehicle is Right for You?</h2><p>It's
without question that both Audi and Mercedes-Benz are two of the most luxurious
brands on the market with a long-standing reputation for delivering a
first-class driving experience. If you're trying to determine which German
lineup to shop from, which brand should you choose? Let's take a look at how
the two measure up in three categories to consider when researching a new
vehicle. </p><ol style="list-style: outside none decimal; padding-left: 30px;"><li><b>Performance</b>:
Audi's legendary quattro® all-wheel drive system leads the class, making it a
more reliable lineup overall. Since Audi is all about all-wheel drive, and
Mercedes only offers all-wheel drive on some of its models, Audi is an obvious
choice when it comes to performance and reliability. Speaking of which, Audi
also beat out Mercedes in <i>Consumer Reports'</i> road test as
being a much more reliable brand over Mercedes. </li><li><b>Price</b>:
Both Mercedes and Audi offer an extensive lineup of luxury sedans, coupes,
crossovers, SUVs and wagons, all ranging in price. If you stack the two up
against each other when it comes to the cost of maintaining both vehicles over
time, Audi costs less to maintain. </li><li><b>Best-In-Class</b>:
After <i>Consumer Reports'</i> performed its road tests, 100
percent of Audi's lineup was recommended as the brand generates owner
satisfaction and delivers satisfactory performance in rollover tests. Only 29
percent of Mercedes' lineup was recommended. </li></ol><h2>Test Drive
